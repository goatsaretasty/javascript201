# Exercise 4: Async/await

## Part 1:

- Print the same information you did in exercise 1 from `people.json`. But with these two changes:
  - Use the promise function you wrote in exercise 3 to read the file
  - Perform the functionality inside of a test and use `async/await` to fetch the result from the promise.
