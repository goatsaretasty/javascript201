Exercise 1: Functional Programming

In this brief exercise, we'll focus on using higher-order functions to modify array data with no side effects. The assignment is to:

- Read the `people.json` file
- Filter out any person object whose `isActive` status is `false` (leaving only active people)
- Modify each person's balance to be greater than or equal to `$1,000,000`
- Print the name of each person, with their current balance
