Exercise 3: Promises

## Pt 1: Write a function which:

- Reads the `people.json` file from the previous example
- Returns a promise which resolves the parsed `people.json` file

## Pt 2: Write a function which _fails at doing the above_:

- **Fails** (somehow - you pick) at doing the task in part 1
- Prints an error message

## Bonus

- _Convert_ the function in `fetch-github-user.js` to return a Promise rather than using a callback
