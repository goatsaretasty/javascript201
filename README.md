# Color Coded: Advanced JavaScript

Welcome to Advanced JavaScript! Over the course of three workshops, we'll explore some of the more advanced features of the JavaScript language and how to build production-ready JavaScript applications.

We will **not** learn (deeply) about specific JavaScript frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, etc.). Instead, we'll focus on how to create maintainable code using patterns and best practices which transcend frameworks.


## Prerequisites

In order to get the most from these workshops you should already:

- Have a basic understanding of JavaScript
	- Loops, functions, modules, callbacks
- Understand version control using `git`
  - clone, commit, push, pull, merge
- Have built small to medium-sized JavaScript applications
